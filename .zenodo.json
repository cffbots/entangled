    "description": "Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated. Entangled makes writing literate programs easier by keeping code blocks in Markdown up-to-date with generated source files. By monitoring the tangled source files, any change in the master document or source files is reflected in the other.",
