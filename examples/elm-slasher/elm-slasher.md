title: Slasher game in Elm
author: Johan Hidding
---

What better waste of time than writing a mind numbing game in a language you don't know? Let's dive into [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/). Elm is a strongly typed functional language that compiles to JavaScript. Its design is centred around the Model/View/Controller concept.

This document may teach you:

* Basics of Elm
* Writing a small browser based game
* Random numbers in Elm (through Cmd/Msg loop)
* Generate SVG

Our game is simple. The original *slasher* game is one I remember from way back when I was playing with [GW Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC). Your hero is zipping around the screen at break neck speeds and the only way to control him is by placing slash `/` and backslash `\` characters from which it bounces off. The goal is to catch the golden snitch which only stays in one place for so long.

# Main

Elm has a set of different application formats, depending on the level of interactivity that is needed:

* **sandbox**: has no interaction with outside world, except through buttons, text fields and forms.
* **element**: can talk to HTTP, use random numbers, and capture browser events.
* **document**: similar to element, but generates the entire document.
* **application**: also handles URL requests and URL changes.

The Elm guide has a section describing the difference between `sandbox` and `element`. The event loop of `element` looks like this:

![`Browser.element` event loop](https://guide.elm-lang.org/effects/diagrams/element.svg)

We will be creating an `element` program, compile it to a JavaScript file, and create a HTML and CSS around it by hand. The lay-out of such a program in Elm looks as follows:

``` {.elm file=src/Main.elm}
<<imports>>
<<main>>

<<model>>
<<update>>
<<subscriptions>>
<<view>>
```

The `main` function tells Elm that we create an `element`

``` {.elm #main}
main =
    Browser.element
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        , view = view }
```

The rest of the program has:

* **model**: Data model of the game. In strongly typed functional languages the design of a program always starts with thinking about type definitions.
* **update**: Defines how to propagate the model from one state to the next.
* **subscriptions**: Subscriptions to external events, that is, events that cannot be bound to an action on a HTML element.
* **view**: Describes how to translate the model state into an HTML element.

## Imports


``` {.elm #imports}
import Browser
import Array exposing (Array, repeat, indexedMap, toList, set, get)
import List exposing (concat)
import Browser.Events exposing (onAnimationFrameDelta, onKeyDown)
import Html exposing (Html, button, div, text, p, input, main_)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick, preventDefaultOn)
import Svg exposing (svg, circle, line, rect, g, polygon, text_)
import Svg.Attributes exposing (..)
import Random

import Json.Decode as Decode
```

# The Model

The *model* will be a grid of cells and two actors: our hero and the snitch (if you like to play around with the code, try to add a list of enemy actors that can hurt the hero).

``` {.elm #model}
type alias Model =
    { actors : { player : Actor, snitch : Actor }
    , grid : Grid
    , snitchTime : Float
    , state : GameState
    , lastPressed : String
    }
```

In addition to the *actors* and the *grid*, we have to keep time, and a game state flag. The game state tells us if the game is running etc.

``` {.elm #model}
type GameState = Start | Running | Pause | Won
```

We define the *grid* as nested arrays of cells, where each cell can have the value `Empty`, `Slash` or `BackSlash`:

``` {.elm #model}
type alias Grid = Array (Array Cell)

type Cell
    = Empty
    | Slash
    | BackSlash
```

Lastly, an `Actor` is something that has a location and a velocity, each a 2-tuple of floats.

``` {.elm #model}
type alias Actor =
    { location : (Float, Float)
    , velocity : (Float, Float)
    }
```

## Config

``` {.elm #model}
type alias Config =
    { gridSize : (Int, Int)
    , playerSpeed : Float
    , scale : Int
    , snitchTime : Float
    }

config : Config
config =
    { gridSize = (80, 50)
    , playerSpeed = 0.03
    , scale = 15
    , snitchTime = 10000
    }
```

## Init

The model is initialised by the `init` function. This function has the funny signature `() -> (Model, Cmd Msg)`. We'll return to the type definition of `Msg` later, but what this means is that the `init` function generates an initial state and a command (or list of commands) that tells the Elm run-time to perform an action upon initialisation. Such an action can be anything that requires some form of external state: HTTP requests, location/time information, and in our case: generating random numbers.

``` {.elm #model}
init : () -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
init _ = 
    let (width, height) = config.gridSize
        playerLoc       = ((toFloat width)/2 + 0.5, 0.5)
    in (
    { actors =
        { player = { location = playerLoc
                   , velocity = (0.0, config.playerSpeed) }
        , snitch = { location = (0.0, 0.0)
                   , velocity = (0.0, 0.0) }
        }
    , grid = makeGrid config.gridSize
    , snitchTime = 0.0
    , state = Start
    , lastPressed = ""
    }, Cmd.batch
    [ Random.generate PlaceSnitch (Random.pair (Random.int 0 79)
                                               (Random.int 0 49))
    ])

makeGrid : (Int, Int) -> Array (Array Cell)
makeGrid (width, height) =
    Array.repeat height
                 (Array.repeat width Empty)
```

# Subscriptions

``` {.elm #subscriptions}
keyDecoder : Decode.Decoder Msg
keyDecoder =
  Decode.map KeyPress (Decode.field "key" Decode.string)

subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions model = Sub.batch
    [ onAnimationFrameDelta TimeStep
    , onKeyDown keyDecoder
    ]
```

# Update

The `update` function has the following signature:

``` {.elm #update-function}
update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
```

This means that, given a *message* and a *model* state, we can generate a new model state and a list of requests to the Elm run-time. This list of requests has the type `Cmd Msg`, telling Elm that, whatever the request, it has to respond with a `Msg`.

``` {.elm #msg-type}
type Msg
    = KeyPress String
    | TimeStep Float
    | PlaceSnitch (Int, Int)
```

In our case, a message is either a `KeyPress` indicating a key being pressed, a `TimeStep` when a new animation frame is triggered or a `PlaceSnitch` when the random number generator returns a fresh pair of coordinates. We'll defer the handling of these messages to helper functions.

``` {.elm #update-function}
update msg model =
    case msg of
        TimeStep dt   -> let next = timeStep dt model
                         in (next, checkSnitchTime next)
        KeyPress k    -> (keyMap k { model | lastPressed = k }, Cmd.none)
        PlaceSnitch l -> (placeSnitch l model, Cmd.none)
```

``` {.elm #update}
<<msg-type>>
<<update-function>>
```

# Completing the game

From the code we can either build a HTML or a JavaScript file for embedding. We will manually create the HTML so that we can also create a stylesheet.

```
$ elm make ./src --output=slasher.js
```

The HTML can be very short now:

``` {.html file=index.html}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="slasher"></div>

    <script src="slasher.js"></script>
    <script>
      Elm.Main.embed(document.getElementById("slasher"));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
